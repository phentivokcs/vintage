  # Fix Cart and Cart Items Policies

  1. Changes
    - Add INSERT policy for carts (users can create their own cart)
    - Add UPDATE policy for carts (users can update their own cart)
    - Add INSERT policy for cart_items (users can add items to their cart)
    - Add UPDATE policy for cart_items (users can update their cart items)
    - Add DELETE policy for cart_items (users can remove items from their cart)

  2. Security
    - All policies check authentication and ownership
    - Users can only manage their own carts and items
